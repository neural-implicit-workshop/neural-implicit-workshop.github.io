### Overview

Computer vision research has recently seen impressive success in creating implicit neural representations of scenes and objects, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and deep Signed Distance Functions (DeepSDFs). Similarly, implicit representations (not necessarily learned) such as SDFs and Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) have been used with great success in robotic motion planning, manipulation, and perception. In this workshop, we seek to explore the future of implicit neural representations (INRs) in robotics. In such a quickly-changing space, our aim is to provide the robotics community with a cohesive and united event to discuss the impacts and possibilities of such implicit neural representations.

Through invited talks and a poster session, we hope to explore:
* how to quickly learn INRs online from sensor data,
* how to tractably reason about uncertainty in these representations,
* how to leverage INRs for robotic localization, motion planning, manipulation, and locomotion tasks,
* how to embed semantic understanding in such representations, and
* how to adapt INRs to simulate and predict dynamic and uncertain scenes.

We hope that this workshop will fuel interest and promote research in learning implicit scene representations for applications in robotics.

The workshop will be in a hybrid format, with a livestream (via Zoom) to allow for virtual participation. More streaming details TBA.
